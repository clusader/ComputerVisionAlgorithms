# ComputerVisionAlgorithms
Implementation and visualization of different CV algorithms.<br>
This includes different performance enhancements for accessing Bitmap files

## Current GUI and Functionality
- Upload any image -> Binarize it.
- Now you can run a choice of different algorithms and play with thresholds to adjust.
